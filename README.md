# IBMAttrition
IBMAttrition prediction
Another take to the IBM Attrition dataset. This project contains data exploration and analysis and uses logistic regression, random forest and random classifier to predict on 3 new employees. The encoding is set manually as an alternative to get_dummies or one hot ending, the results are very similar to those using these encoders. Random forest gets closer to the real values.
